# RackPing API 2.0 Client Sample Programs

Sample programs in several programming languages that you can copy-and-paste to automate common RackPing Monitoring tasks from the command line, custom scripts or cron.

These are end-user sample client programs that call the RackPing Monitoring API 2.0.

The philosophy is that they should be easy-to-use, standalone (minimal or no dependencies), cut-and-paste code that illustrate common monitoring automation tasks.

See the README in each folder above for language-specific installation notes.
